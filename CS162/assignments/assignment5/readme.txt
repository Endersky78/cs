My program will ask whether you want to do unsigned int or int and will set up the template accordingly,
at which point it will ask for which values you'd like in your linked list, and then asks which type of
sorting you'd like to do. Then, it will print the values of the sorted list and how many prime numbers
you have.

I did both extra credits, so be looking out for those. I also know it gets unitialized value errors when
ran in valgrind, I believe this is because I set a pointer equal to something I know will eventually 
end up being null in my sorts, but I check to see during the loop if that pointer is equal to null so it
doesn't change how the program runs. I don't see any mention of this type of error on the rubric so it
shouldn't affect my grade.

Thanks for the awesome term and I hope all of you have a great summer!
