# Overview
This repository is my space to remotely save my computer science classwork so that in the event of some issue causing me to lose my work locally,
it's the not the end of the world. I also use this as a place to reference after classes are over, in case I work with the same languages or similar
concepts. <br> <br>
If you are looking through this as someone wanting to see an example of me applying what I've learned throughout my degree, below, I've provided
the class description as well as any notable assignments that are worth looking through grouped by class code. 

## CS 344 - Operating Systems
Introduction to operating systems using UNIX as the case study. System calls and utilities, fundamentals of processes and interprocess communication. 

[**Assignment 3:**](https://github.com/jackhart591/cs/tree/main/CS%20344/Assignment%203) This assignment asked us to create a "small" shell. In order to
do this, I parsed input into a command struct I created, and then either executed my own commands I made (cd, status, exit), or asked the shell to
execute it for me using the family of exec functions in C. In this assignment, I also implemented background processes and signal handling for SIGINT and
SIGTSTP. 

## CS 290 - Web Development
How to design and implement a multi-tier application using web technologies: Creation of extensive custom client- and server-side code, consistent with
achieving a high-quality software architecture.

[**Final Project:**](https://github.com/osu-cs290-sp22/final-project-rubber-ducky-boys/tree/a1ea1c34a50429167952f99d0aa81c35262eec1d) For this assignment,
we had to create a website using the tools we learned throughout the term as a team. In my team, we decided to make a forum for computer science students
called "Rubber Ducky". For this, we created a dynamically generated website using a combination of Node.js and Handlebars, and through doing this, gave me
the experience I needed to create my [personal website](https://github.com/jackhart591/Personal-Website).
